The different sections of this homework are broken down into the sections outlined in [the homework instructions](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/hw02/hw02.html): 

Task list: 
1. -[] Getting Started: Install Gapminder & dyplyr
2. -[]Smell test the data: Explore the gapminder object
3. -[]Explore individual variables:
4. -[]Explore various plot types: 
5. -[]Extra exercise: 
6. -[]Conclusions:



####Getting Started:
Install Gapminder and dyplyr (through the tidyverse package)
```{r}
install.packages("gapminder")
library(gapminder)
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```


####Smell test the data:
Explore the gapminder object:
```{r}
(typeof(gapminder))
(str(gapminder))
(ncol(gapminder))
(nrow(gapminder))
(summary(gapminder))
```

####Explore individual variables
```{r}

```

####Explore various plot types
 - A scatterplot of two quantitative variables.
 - A plot of one quantitative variable. Maybe a histogram or densityplot or frequency polygon.
 - A plot of one quantitative variable and one categorical. Maybe boxplots for several continents or countries.
```{r}

```


####Extra Exercise:

Instructions: Evaluate this code and describe the result. Presumably the analystâ€™s intent was to get the data for Rwanda and Afghanistan. Did they succeed? Why or why not? If not, what is the correct way to do this?
```{r}
filter(gapminder, country == c("Rwanda", "Afghanistan"))
```
